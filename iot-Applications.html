 <h2> Introduction</h2>   
 <p>
    Hello, I am Osheen Sharma(2110994778) and i am currently in 4th Semester of Software Engineering. Till now I have had the experience to study 12 units
    out of which i enjoyed the most working on Embedded Systems Development. In this unit SIT209 I want to work really hard to achieve High Distinction grade
    because i believe after completing this unit a student can be a full stack developer and learn many important things for future use.

<h2>Activity 1</h2> 
<p>
 IoT apps analyse vast volumes of linked sensor data in the cloud using machine learning algorithms and help getting real time data as 
 notification on dashboards. It is a network of physical objects - "things" - with embedded sensors, software and other technologies to 
 connect and exchange data with other devices and systems on the Internet. The main features of IoT appliction are analyzing, security, accuracy and
 real time data etc. It is used in almost every sphere of life for example: Online shopping, healthcare, industrial use, smart homes, agricultural use and many more.
</p>

<h2>Activity 2</h2> 
<p>
 We learnt what smart means i.e. is the ability to connect, share and interact with its user and other smart devices making the device bothprogrammable and responsive
 to the needs of the user. it provides many useful feautures like comfort, security, reliability, sustainability, time management, personalisation, predictive maintenance, etc.
 Some of the scenarios for the same are security system, parking system, water management system, HVAC etc.

<h2> Activity 3</h2>
<p>
 The control interface is a protocol that allows communication between peripheral devices and the microcontroller. Depending on the application, a special control interface may be required. 
 It is a border that contains a collection of methods for enforcing security regulations and controlling the flow of information between networked information systems.
 It is very flexible and secure. Different devices use different interfaces for example- TVremote has a user interface that consists of various buttons, and
 devices such as Amazon Echocan be controlled with voice commands.
